<h1>Testing plan</h1>

<h2>Purpose:</h2>

<p>The main purpose of this plan is to introduce a testing strategy, which will be used to test the web application.<br>
In addition, the testing plan introduces the ways of how testing results should be recorded.</p>
<h2>Project Overview:</h2>
<p>Web application Treasure Hunt is an online quiz, in which players can answer specific questions, that depend on their location at the moment of playing the game.<br>
    Functionality includes geolocation, QR code scanner, use of API and use of cookies.</p>
<h2>Testers:</h2>
<p>Testers will perform tasks specified in this testing plan and will record the results of the testing on this page.<br>
For now, the testing team consists of: Pavel Telnov.<br>
    The testing team may change over time, if it did so, the Testers section must be updated.</p>
<h2>Test objectives</h2>
<p>The objective of the testing of the Web Application is to ensure that the functionality of Treasure Hunt is working according to the given specifications.<br>
The final result of the testing should include:<br>
Tested software, which is free of major errors, and which is passed the specifications.<br>
Testing page, which will use a Testing API to insure that Treasure Hunt is working properly.<br>
    Unit tests, which would help testing an application, must be commented out prior to submission.</p>
<h2>Tests:</h2>
<h3>Exploratory</h3>
<p>The main type of tests, which would be performed, due to the lack of resources and time.<br>
Purpose: The main purpose of this type of test is to find major errors and remove them before another testing.<br>
Testers: Testing team<br>
    Method: Exploratory testing does not require any documentation prior to testing, it is testing on the fly, in which testers come up with a test, which they execute immediately.</p>
<h3>Functional test.</h3>
<p>Purpose: Is to ensure that the output of the application is the same as the expected one, trough Unit tests<br>
Testers: Testing team<br>
    Method: Creation and use of unit tests, which would use a Testing API to compare the expected output with an existing one.</p>
<h3>User acceptance Test</h3>
<p>Scope: Getting the list of games, Main game functionality(getting questions, sending answers), QR code scanner,  Geolocation, Leaderboard<br>
Assumptions:<br>
All test cases related to UAT must be documented on the testing page<br>
Testers: Pavel Telnov<br>
Time frame: Test results should be provided by 23 March 2021.<br>
Resources:<br>
Human resources(At the moment of creating the plan): 1 tester for 10 days.<br>
Tested operating systems: Windows 10<br>
    Browser tests: Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Edge.</p>

<h4>UAT Risks</h4>
<p>1.Not properly trained testers High Probability Medium Impact<br>
    2.Lack of testers High Probability Medium Impact</p>
<h4>UAT entry criteria</h4>
<p>All features must be implemented<br>
All critical bugs must be fixed<br>
Before UAT exploratory and functional testing should be done.</p>
