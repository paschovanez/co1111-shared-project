### Testing plan 

## Purpose: 

The main purpose of this plan is to introduce a testing strategy, which will be used to test the web application.  
In addition, the testing plan introduces the ways of how testing results should be recorded.  
## Project Overview:
Web application Treasure Hunt is an online quiz, in which players can answer specific questions, that depend on their location at the moment of playing the game.  
Functionality includes geolocation, QR code scanner, use of API and use of cookies.  
## Testers:
Testers will perform tasks specified in this testing plan and will record the results of the testing on this page.   
For now, the testing team consists of: Pavel Telnov.  
The testing team may change over time, if it did so, the Testers section must be updated.  
## Test objectives
The objective of the testing of the Web Application is to ensure that the functionality of Treasure Hunt is working according to the given specifications.  
The final result of the testing should include:   
Tested software, which is free of major errors, and which is passed the specifications.  
Testing page, which will use a Testing API to insure that Treasure Hunt is working properly.   
Unit tests, which would help testing an application, must be commented out prior to submission.   
## Tests:
# Exploratory

Purpose: The main purpose of this type of test is to find major errors and remove them before another testing.    
Testers: Testing team    
Method: Exploratory testing does not require any documentation prior to testing, it is testing on the fly, in which testers come up with a test, which they execute immediately.     
# Functional test.
Purpose: Is to ensure that the output of the application is the same as the expected one, trough Unit tests    
Testers: Testing team    
Method: Creation and use of unit tests, which would use a Testing API to compare the expected output with an existing one.     
# User acceptance Test
Scope: Getting the list of games, Main game functionality(getting questions, sending answers), QR code scanner,  Geolocation, Leaderboard     
Assumptions:

Time frame: Test results should be provided by 23 March 2021.    
Resources:    
Human resources(At the moment of creating the plan): 1 tester for 10 days.
