<p>Members: Pavel, Stamatios<br>
Done: At the time of the meeting functionality of the landing page is almost done.<br>
Aims: We need to add information about the game + information in the footer(links to social media, etc).<br>
3 webpages are still missing : notes, leaderboard, about us.<br>
We should upgrade our cookies, so they will support tracking of answered questions for our map of the path through treasure hunt(check assignment brief).<br>
The main functionality(questions, score etc) is still under development.<br>
Stamatious will take time to get used to code, that was written already<br>
Pavel will continue working on the main functionality.</p>

# Meeting 1 27.02.2021 21:00
<p>Members: Pavel, Pascal<br>
  Pascal proposed a redesigning and restructuring code of the landing page, in the near days, he will get used to the code.<br>
   Additional information section should be redesigned because for now, it stands out from other design of the page.<br>
   In the future, additional navigation links should be included in the footer.<br>
   The logo of the page might need to be replaced, due to its origin</p>
