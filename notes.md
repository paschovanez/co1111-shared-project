# Meeting 1 27.02.2021
Members: Pavel, Stamatios
Done: At the time of the meeting functionality of the landing page is almost done.
Aims: We need to add information about the game + information in the footer(links to social media, etc).
3 webpages are still missing : notes, leaderboard, about us.
We should upgrade our cookies, so they will support tracking of answered questions for our map of the path through treasure hunt(check assignment brief).
The main functionality(questions, score etc) is still under development.
Stamatious will take time to get used to code, that was written already
Pavel will continue working on the main functionality.
