# Meeting 1 27.02.2021 13:00
<p>Members: Pavel, Stamatios<br>
Done: At the time of the meeting functionality of the landing page is almost done.<br>
Aims: We need to add information about the game + information in the footer(links to social media, etc).<br>
3 webpages are still missing : notes, leaderboard, about us.<br>
We should upgrade our cookies, so they will support tracking of answered questions for our map of the path through treasure hunt(check assignment brief).<br>
The main functionality(questions, score etc) is still under development.<br>
Stamatious will take time to get used to code, that was written already<br>
Pavel will continue working on the main functionality.</p>

# Meeting 2 27.02.2021 21:00
<p>Members: Pavel, Pascal<br>
  Pascal proposed a redesigning and restructuring code of the landing page, in the near days, he will get used to the code.<br>
   Additional information section should be redesigned because for now, it stands out from other design of the page.<br>
   In the future, additional navigation links should be included in the footer.<br>
   The logo of the page might need to be replaced, due to its origin</p>
   
# Meeting 3 04.03.2021 
<p>TODO list: <br>
  Score is not working for some reason, for now it is implemeted with an API, probably will be a good idea to implement score with cookies instead of using api.<br>
  Leaderboard in the wrong place, for now it is accessed via nav menu in the landing page. We need to implement leaderboard at the end of the treasue hunt.<br>
  QR code reader is missing, needs to be implemented.<br>
  There should be a different input fields for different questions.</p>
  
 # Meeting 4 06.03.2021 
 <p>Fixed the score, leaderboard was moved to the right place, although it is still possible to get to the leaderboard through a landing page.<br>
  We should start thinking about how to implement a map of the previous questions.<br>
  Our Twitter is still empty, we must do something with it.<br>
  The style on the start page is needed to be enhanced.<br>
  Pavel will implement different input fields by the end of the day</p>
  
  # Meeting 5 09.03.2021
  <p>Pavel implemented different input fields, added a tweet in our team twitter<br>
    About Us page will be complited at the end of the day.<br>
    For some reason application is not working on the iphone, it may be a problem with a cookies.<br>
    Added our first unit test, which tests our cookies.<br>
    There is also a problem with a leaderboard since it is not working properly on the mobile phones(nav menu)<br>
    TODO:<br>
    User acceptance plan, map of the questions, QR scanner, style of pages.</p>
