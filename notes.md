# Meeting 1 27.02.2021
<p>Members: Pavel, Stamatios<br>
Done: At the time of the meeting functionality of the landing page is almost done.<br>
Aims: We need to add information about the game + information in the footer(links to social media, etc).<br>
3 webpages are still missing : notes, leaderboard, about us.<br>
We should upgrade our cookies, so they will support tracking of answered questions for our map of the path through treasure hunt(check assignment brief).<br>
The main functionality(questions, score etc) is still under development.<br>
Stamatious will take time to get used to code, that was written already<br>
Pavel will continue working on the main functionality.</p>
